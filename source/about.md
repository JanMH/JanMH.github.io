I'm Jan, a software developer currently living somewhere in Europe. In this blog I talk about my adventures in programming and cooking. 

Theoretically you can also hire me. Then again, this blog might not seem very professional. If you want to see a polished website like the ones you see in advertisements, head over to [jan-herlyn.com](https://jan-herlyn.com). Anyways, this blog is not that. It's about the brutal and honest truth.
