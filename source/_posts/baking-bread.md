Have you ever wondered how professionals turn water, flour, salt and yeast into magic.

Well I have great news for you! Here are a few tricks to improve your baking game 100x.

1. The right amount of water. Especially for pizza this is essential. To get to the right ratio, just make a very wet dough and then slowly add flour while kneading until the dough doesn't stick to your hands anymore.
2. Add a sufficient amount of salt. Usually one tea spoon per 500 g of flour
3. Let it rest twice. Let it rest for a long time, depending on the type of dough you are making. For Pizza I let it sit about 8 hours . Then, 1 hour before you bake it, knead the dough again and cut it into the individual parts that you want to bake and form a ball.

That's all folks.
