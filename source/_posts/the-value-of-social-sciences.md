 In this post I share my opinion about the value of social sciences
---

When I was studying computer science in the Technical University of Munich I generally had a good time. One thing that irks me to this day though was the half joking disrespect to social sciences. But of course, cs students are not the only people that sometimes discount the value of courses like philosophy or sociology. In fact if you go on youtube or google to see what you want to study, you will find videos like "The most worthless college majors" featuring specialized fields like "tourism" and "photography" but also "anthropology", "philosophy", "gender studies" etc.

Of course I can see where they are coming from... expected salary post degree. But these lists also show a more fundamental trend that many people do not see social sciences as contributing value to our society. With majors like software engineering, chemistry, physics and engineering the value provided is very obvious: without them, we would not be able to feed as many people, construct buildings that give shelter to many and have such a wide variety of entertainment at our disposal. But as we build and invent more and more, we also lose more and more sight of the morality of it all.

As we are more connected by social media, our ideas and ideals shift and focus more on the platforms that we use constantly to communicate with each other. An idea seems to only ba as valuable as the amount of likes it has while it is suddenly easy to "block" and cut of all contact with someone because he or she has posted a view we deem as unacceptable. At the same time it has become trivially easy to join groups of people who share our views. Suddenly it is "us" vs "them" or "the right does this" and "the left is that".

But it is not only our social life that shifts to the digital space. There is a global shift to teach more stem, automate education with computers and automated tests and digital "personalized learning experiences". But these methods of teaching optimize for the wrong metric: knowledge retention and applicability to future jobs. It is not immediately evident why these should be the wrong metrics. Should we not want our kids to have the biggest advantage in employability and as much relevant knowledge about the world? 

Of course these things are desirable but there is a deeper purpose to education that gets more and more forgotten. Education isn't about giving people knowledge because no matter what you teach kids. Most of the relevant knowledge they will have to acquire themselves anyways. How much relevant knowledge can a school teach a kid about becoming a doctor and an offshore oil rig operator? It is about giving kids the tools to teach themselves and think critically. To emancipate them and making them into independent adults.

This is also what the age of enlightenment strived for: to break with dogmatic belief regarding science, culture and politics. To maximize personal freedom and teach people to question the status quo. If you watch the stem approach to education, we are in many ways making huge steps backwards. A computer program with a multiple choice test cannot teach you anything but dogmatic belief in the current ideas of science, preventing us from questioning pas models. Social media pushes us into conflicting camps that have dogmatic beliefs about how society is supposed to behave and who we are tu support in government. In the universities we have professors reigning over their little fiefdoms with little to no accountability.

This is the world, we as stem majors have built. And for all the good that the hard sciences have brought to humanity we have to assume responsibility for the negative social consequences of the digitalization of society. This is where we need social sciences to help us out. To act as a moral compass and a watcher. To tell us when we are wrong.
